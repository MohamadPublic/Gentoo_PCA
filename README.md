# Description

This code explores the dimensionality-reduction method of PCA. The data is the Flipper and Bill length of the female Gentoo penguins from the `palmer penguins` dataset.

A linear transformation from $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ is discovered as the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the sample variance-covariance matrix of the centered data ($\hat{\Sigma}v = \lambda v$).
